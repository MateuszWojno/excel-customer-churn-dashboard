## 📈 Key Insights
👥 Age Impact: Customers aged 45–54 exhibit the highest churn rate (47.81%), making this the most at-risk age segment.

🔄 Engagement Matters: Inactive customers are nearly twice as likely to churn compared to active ones (26.85% vs. 14.27%).

🧩 Product Overload Risk: Customers owning 4 products show extreme churn (100%), suggesting product fatigue or poor product fit.

💰 Income Effect: Customers earning below $50K demonstrate significantly higher churn risk, identifying income as a strong churn driver.

👩‍🦰 Gender Difference: Female customers churn more frequently than male customers (55.85% vs. 44.15%).

💳 Card Usage: Customers without a credit card churn slightly more than cardholders (24.10% vs. 23.20%).

📦 Product Count Trend: Churn increases with the number of products owned, peaking sharply at 4 products.

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

🎯 Target High-Risk Age Group (45–54)
Develop tailored retention campaigns for customers aged 45–54, including personalized offers, loyalty programs, and proactive support.

🔔 Re-Engage Inactive Customers
Launch automated re-engagement workflows (email, app notifications, call campaigns) for inactive users, as inactivity nearly doubles churn risk.

🧩 Optimize Product Bundling Strategy
Investigate why customers with 4 products churn at 100%. Simplify bundles, introduce modular offerings, and conduct customer feedback analysis to improve product-market fit.

💰 Support Lower-Income Customers
Provide targeted financial products, fee reductions, and flexible plans for customers earning below $50K to improve long-term retention.

👩‍💼 Address Gender Churn Gap
Analyze product experience by gender and improve services or communications for female customers where friction points appear.

💳 Increase Credit Card Adoption
Encourage credit card enrollment with low-risk entry offers and benefits, as cardholders show slightly lower churn.

📦 Implement Smart Cross-Selling
Focus on quality over quantity in cross-selling strategies to avoid product fatigue while maximizing customer lifetime value.
